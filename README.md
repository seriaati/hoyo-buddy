## Goal

The community has been missing a Discord bot that provides support for all Hoyoverse games, and Hoyo Buddy is here to change that. We try to create **ONE** bot that can do **EVERYTHING** for all Hoyoverse games, with beautfiul designs and intuitive interfaces, all for free. Hoyo Buddy is currently the only Discord bot that provides multi-game, multi-account, and multi-language support.
